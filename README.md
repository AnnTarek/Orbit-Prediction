# Orbit-Prediction

**Objective**:
This project explores the relationship between time and orbital positions using a Keras-based neural network to perform polynomial regression.

**Dataset Description**:
The dataset is a uni-feature dataset; it has only 1 feature: the time orbit locations were taken. Orbit locations are our target 

**Steps to run the code**:
1. Download the ipynb file and the dataset file.
2. Upload the notebook on Colab then upload the dataset.
3. Run the whole code to see the results by yourself.

Note: Required libraries are Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, matplotlib, and sklearn
